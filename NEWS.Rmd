# FAMoS 0.2.0

## Major changes

* FAMoS can now handle cost functions that do not rely on AIC(c) or BIC. Any selection criterion can be used and FAMoS will attempt to minimise it. Therefore, the option _nr.of.data_ was removed. The selection criterion value now needs to be returned by the cost function _fit.fn_. 

* FAMoS can now use other fitting routines than _optim_. The custom fitting routines can be included in the cost function _fit.fn_. The use of a custom fitting routine requires to set _use.optim = FALSE_. In this case, the cost function _fit.fn_ needs to return a list containing the selection criterion value as well as a named parameter vector describing the optimised fit.

## Minor changes

* Graphic settings get returned to their previous values after calling FAMoS plotting functions.

* Log files are no longer saved using _sink_.

* The default number for _optim.runs_ was set to 1.

* Futures are no longer used as default option.

* The function _sc.order_ now plots logarithmically, if the ratio between minimal and maximal values is larger than 300.

* FAMoS now checks during each run, if the used cost function has changed. In this case, an interactive warning will be issued to the user.

* Included an option to silence the verbose output of FAMoS (_verbose = FALSE_).

* FAMos now returns the total number of tested models.

* If a custom fitting routine is used, no previous applicability checks are performed.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed the problem of multiple best models. If multiple best models are found, only the first one is used.

* The function _famos.performance_ now displays the grid properly.
